# How do I search data within the GeoHub?

## Search Settings

Using the “Search tab”, simply enter the name of the needed data set and the GeoHub will match the most relevant data set that the user desire.Search option will render the most specific bucket of interest as the user either enters the SDG number or words that are found in the SDG goal name/title. For example, for SDG 13, the user can enter 13 or type "climate" and/or "action".
Settings will allow the "Text search" to match all words typed or at least one word typed.It also gives the option to be filtered by the Geospatial extent.

## Explore by tags

The Explore by tags option allows the user to filter their search even further.Each tag can be expanded to niche levels of filtering which allows the user to obtain the most specific data they require.
The option of selecting "Match all selected tags" will allow the user to select multiple tags and obtain results for all or the user can select the "Match at least a tag selected" will allow the search to only generate results specific to that particular tag.

As the data sets appear on the website, the GeoHub generates a preview of the layer including its meta data.Then simply click the
"Add layer" button to view the complete result.
