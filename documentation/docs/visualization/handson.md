# Hands-on exercise

In this exercise, we are going to create a map with a dataset from GeoHub. Let's begin.

## Open a blank map page

## Add a dataset to map

## Change layer style

## Save a map

## Share a URL with your colleague

## Extra challenge

Now you can search any other datasets in addition to the data layer we have created previously. Try to overlay other layers to make a beautiful map.
