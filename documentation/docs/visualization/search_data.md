# How do I search data within the GeoHub?

## Filtering Buckets 
The user can use the “Filter Bucket” to find the Sustainable Development Goal of their interest. 
The filtering option will render the most specific bucket of interest as the user either enters the SDG number or words that are found in the SDG goal name/title. For example, for SDG 1, the user can enter 1 or type "end" and/or "poverty".
