# How do I search data within the GeoHub?

## Search Tab

Using the “Search tab”, simply enter the name of the needed data set and the GeoHub will match the most relevant data set under a specific bucket. For example, by typing the word "sustainable" and pressing the enter button generates the data sets which are tagged with the name "sustainable" in their layer title, description and name.

The user can also enter an individual bucket of interest and type in the data they desire and then the search results will be limited to the extent of the datasets in that particular bucket.
