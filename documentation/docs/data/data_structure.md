# How is the data arranged in the GeoHub?

We follow a unique way to arrange our data sets! All the data sets within the UNDP GeoHub are arranged in "Buckets".

<justify> The first bucket is the “SDG” bucket which entails all data related to Sustainable Development Goals. </p>

<justify>The second bucket is the “Microsoft Planetary” which connects to all the satellite data sets of the Microsoft Planetary Computer where the user can engage in further analysis.</p>

<justify>The third bucket includes the “Dynamic Vector Data” which contains vector data for dynamic analytics.

With recent updates, data is also found under the major data provider buckets UNDP, UNICEF,UNEP and FAO.

All data is also arranged under the Continenet bucket where data is devised by regions and countries based on availability of data.
