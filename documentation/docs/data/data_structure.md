# How is the data arranged in the GeoHub?

We follow a unique way to arrange our data sets! All the data sets within the UNDP GeoHub are arranged under three main “Buckets” and found under the Home page.

<justify> The first bucket is the “SDG” bucket which entails all data related to Sustainable Development Goals. </p>

<justify>The second bucket is the “Microsoft Planetary” which connects to all the satellite data sets of the Microsoft Planetary Computer where the user can engage in further analysis.</p>

<justify>The third bucket includes the “Dynamic Vector Data” which contains vector data for dynamic analytics.
