Firstly, please open _Datasets_ page from [here](https://geohub.data.undp.org/data) as new tab or new window.

Then, select **Datasets** tab if you signed in. If you do not sign in, tabs are not shown.

- **Datasets** tab: Switch between datasets and my data. The number in brackets show the number of datasets on the result table.
- **Text filter**: Type any keywords to search datasets
- **Search result**: The result of datasets search is shown as **Card view** or **List view** or **Map view**.
- Various tag filteration: At the top-right of the table, you can do advanced tag filtration or search settings.

### Card view

When you select **Card** in the segment buttons of top-right of search result, the result will be represented as a **Card view**. Thie view type can be useful for you to check datasets with a preview image. The random layer style will be applied to a preview image if there is no default style saved.

### List view

When you select **List** in the segment buttons of top-right of search result, the result will be represented as a **List view**. This view type might be useful for you to explore some detailed metadata for each result quickly.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![search_table_3](../assets/data/search_table_3.png){:style="width: 100%;"}
  <figcaption>List view search</figcaption>
</figure>

The following properties are shown as List view.

- Dataset name: the title of dataset
- Description: the description of dataset.
- SDG: The numbers of SDG goal will be shown if the dataset is linked to them.
- License: Data license is shown
- Updated at: the datetime when owner updated last time
- Star icon: The state of whether you add this dataset to your favourite. You can also click the icon to favourite from the list view directly.

If you click a row of the table, you can move to an individual dataset page for further actions.

### Map view

When you select **Map** in the segment buttons of top-right of search result, the result will be represented as a **Map view**. This view type can be helpful for you to explore datasets from geospatial locations.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![search_table_4](../assets/data/search_table_4.png){:style="width: 100%;"}
  <figcaption>Map view search</figcaption>
</figure>

A popup will be shown when you click a blue highlighted polygon to see the title and description of datasets. You can move to an individual data page from the link on a popup.

!!! note

    The most of datasets on GeoHub are global datasets, that means this **Map view** may not be very useful to search. In such case, you can tick the checkbox of _Hide global/satellite datasets from the map_ on the top-left corner of the map. Global datasets will be exluded from **Map view** if you do so.

## Next step

In next section, we are going to learn how to search dataset at _Map_ page.
