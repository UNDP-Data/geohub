title: Searching datasets on Map page
---

In the previous section, you learned how you can search datasets in the three view types. But you can also search the same datasets from **Data** tab of _Map_ page slightly differently.

## Open Map page

Please open _Map_ page from [here](https://geohub.data.undp.org/maps/edit) as new tab or new window. Then, select **Data** tab at the sidebar.

## How is the data arranged in the _Map_ page?

We follow a unique way to arrange our data sets! All the data sets within the UNDP GeoHub are arranged in "Buckets".

All data is also arranged under the Continenet bucket where data is devised by regions and countries based on availability of data.

- **Bucket search area**: You can explore datasets from a bucket
- **Keyword search**: It provides you to search in free keywords.
- **Sorting order**: You can change the sorting order of search result.
- **Search settings**: You can change some search settings such as **AND** search or **OR** search.

## Explore by special buckets

The first bucket is the **SDG** bucket which entails all data related to Sustainable Development Goals.

The second bucket is the **Satellite Imagery** which connects to all the satellite data sets from the third party data providers where the user can engage in further analysis.

The third bucket includes the **Dynamic Vector Data** which contains vector data for dynamic analytics.

With recent updates, data is also found under the major data provider buckets UNDP, UNICEF,UNEP and FAO.

You can also explore your favourite datasets from **Favourite** bucket or explore your own uploaded datasets from **My data** bucket.

### Explore from SDG category

Within the SDG bucket, the user can search all the updated and relevant data related to the Sustainable Development Goals and their performance.

Data is arranged by the relevant goal and by clicking on each of the SDG icons , the user is able to view all the data under that particular goal.

### Explore Dynamic Vector Data

Vector layers hosted by the UNDP with added features for speacial cases with further analytics are available under this bucket and it is a significant key feature of the GeoHub.
Data related to SDG indicators are represented as vector layers which is dynamic and arranged according to available years.

It also hosts administrative layers.

### Explore Satellite Imagery

Under this bucket the user can find searchable spatio temporal metadata describing Earth science datasets (called **STAC (Spatiao Temporal Asset Catalog)**) hosted by the third party data providers such as _Microsoft Planetary Computer_, _Earth Search_, _Maxar Open Data_ or _JAXA_ .This allows the user to load a range of data sets from satelites such as MODIS, Landsat, Copernicus and many more.

### Explore by some UN agencies

There are special buckets for specific UN agencies. You can find the following UN agencies icons.

- UNDP
- UNICEF
- UNEP
- FAO

You can explore datasets from these buckets.

### Search by keyword

You can type any keyword in textbox to search datasets within the current bucket. If you are in the bucket of **SDG1**, your typed keyword will filter datasets within **SDG1** bucket.

In next section, we are going to explore some of existing datasets at GeoHub.
