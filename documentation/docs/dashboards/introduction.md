# What is a Dashboard?

A dashboard is a way of displaying various types of visual data in one place. Usually, a dashboard is intended to convey different, but related information in an easy-to-digest form. And oftentimes, this includes things like key performance indicators (KPI)s or other important metrics that stakeholders need to see and understand at a glance.

Select the ![Map_UNDP_Dashboards.png](../assets/data/Map_UNDP_Dashboards.png) icon which will take you to the next page with available dashboards.
To return back to the GeoHub, the Home icon on the upper corner should be clicked.
