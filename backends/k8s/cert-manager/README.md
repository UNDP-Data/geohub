# Automatic TLS/SSL certificates provisioning

[cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager) is used to ensure security or deployed services the cluster. The cert-manager works hand in hand with the cluster's ingress controller and the DNS server/manager to ensure a smooth setup and operation

## Installation

There are multiple ways to install cert-manager (help, kubectl). The advantage of using kubectl is that uninstalling is **easier** because cert-manager is installing many custom resources.

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.9.1/cert-manager.yaml

#check  installation
kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager

```

## Uninstall

It is recommended to follow/consult the official doc on [uninstalling](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubectl/#uninstalling)

```
    kubectl delete -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.9.1/cert-manager.yaml

```

## DNS services

The deployed services in the cluster are exposed to the internet using ingress resources. A ingress associates a hostname with a service. Note that ingresses are **namespace** specific resources, taht is each namespace outght to have an its ingress. The **hostnames** are ususally managed through a DNS service. In this case we use the domain undpgeohub.org that we manage through [cloudflare](www.cloudflare.com) which allows cert-manager to validate domain ownership through API Tokens. As a result a secret resource needs to be defined in the cert-manager namespace to provide this token.

1. create API token in cloudflare dashboard usingh DNS template

2. create CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN env var in scripts/.env

```bash
    CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="TOKEN-VALUE
```

3. load the env var

```bash
    set -o allexport
    source scripts/.env
    set +o allexport
```

4. apply and check

```bash
    envsubst < yaml/cloudflare-apitoken-secret.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

    #check
    kubectl get secret -n cert-manager | grep cloud
```

## clusteissuer

The clusterissuer is a cluster wide resource that represent certificate authorities (CAs) able to sign certificates in response to certificate signing requests.

### Letsencrypt

[letsencrypt](www.letsencrypt.org) is a non-profit certificate authority run by Internet Security Research Group that provides X.509 certificates for Transport Layer Security encryption at no charge.

```bash
    kubectl apply -f yaml/le-cluster-issuer.yaml

    #check
    kubectl get clusterissuer
```

### ZeroSSL

[zerossl](https://zerossl.com/) ZeroSSL is a one-stop solution for SSL certificate creation and management, allowing users to create website security certificates issued by ZeroSSL either using a fast and straightforward user interface, using ACME integrations, or using a full-fledged SSL REST API. With zerossl an account is required and the ZeroSSL dashboard can be used to generate EAB credentials. This will be used to create a secret that the issuer will use to authenticate.

1. fetch EAB HMAC key and ID from zerossl developer section

2. create ZEROSSL_HMAC_KEY env var

```bash
    ZEROSSL_HMAC_KEY="KEY_VALUE"

```

3. load the env var

```bash
    set -o allexport
    source scripts/.env
    set +o allexport
```

4. apply and check

```bash
    envsubst < yaml/zerossl-hmac-key-secret.yaml | kubectl apply -f -

    #check
    kubectl get secret -n cert-manager | grep zero
```

5. add key id into the (zerossl issuer)[./yaml/zerossl-cluster-issuer.yaml]

```yaml
externalAccountBinding:
  keyID: keyid-value
```

6. create the issuer and check

```bash

    kubectl apply -f yaml/zerossl-cluster-issuer.yaml
     #check
    kubectl get clusterissuer
```

## script based setup

The [scripts](./scripts/) folder contains bash scripts that can
install/uninstall the cert-manager and its associated resources provided they are invoked from current directory
