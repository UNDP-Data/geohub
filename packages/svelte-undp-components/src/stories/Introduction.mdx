# Welcome to Storybook for svelte-undp-components

This storybook helps you design, develop and test components for UNDP [GeoHub](https://geohub.data.undp.org).

The source code is available at [this repository](https://github.com/UNDP-Data/geohub/tree/develop/packages/svelte-undp-components).

## Requirements

The components rely on the following two css library:

- [Bulma](https://bulma.io): CSS Framework used in this package
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com): Icon used in this package

Please import the above libarary's CSS in your svelte file.

If you develop a website with UNDP design system, we have our customized `bulma` css which is called `@undp-data/undp-bulma`. You can import our css to your sveltekit.

```shell
npm i -D @undp-data/undp-bulma
```

Then, import `undp-bulma` css.

```ts
import '@undp-data/undp-bulma/dist/undp-bulma.css';
```

For showing tooltip in some components, we use tippy.js. Thus, you might need to import CSS file from tippy.js as shown in below.

```js
import 'tippy.js/dist/tippy.css';
import 'tippy.js/themes/light.css';
```

## Installation
